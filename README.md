Hello! My name is Alexander Dow. I am a 28 year old college graduate.
I graduted from BYU in April 2020 with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
I am looking for a full-time job in the software development or IT industries.
While at BYU, I worked for the campus library's IT department.
Since I studied CS and worked in IT, I am familiar with both industries and am willing to work in either.
I am currently studying to take the CompTIA A+ certification test.
I also recently acquired a Raspberry Pi, so I have started looking into projects to do with that.
When I'm not studying or job searching, I enjoy gaming with friends, volleyball, and playing the harmonica.
Please let me know if you have any questions!
You can contact me through my email: adow0331@gmail.com

My GH repository is mostly projects from various CS classes I took while at school.
